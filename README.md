# Facial Recognition Project

> A Python application for real-time facial recognition using **dlib** and **OpenCV**.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates real-time **facial recognition** using the dlib library for face detection, facial landmark detection, and face recognition. It utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model for face recognition and a shape predictor model for facial landmark detection.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition from webcam feed.
- Matches detected faces with a known face for recognition.
- Adjustable threshold for recognition accuracy.

## Installation

1. Install Required libraries by running this code in your Terminal.
 ```pip install opencv-python dlib numpy```


2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/therohanrathee/FaceRecon.git
   $ cd FaceRecon



## Usage

1. Add/Replace the  "_**known_face**.jpeg_" with your own image which has a face clearly distinguishable.
2. Ensure to rename the image file as **known_face.jpeg**.
3. Ensure that the Image is in the same directory as the code
4. Run the Code
